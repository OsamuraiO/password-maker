# password-maker
A password maker written in Python

Colorama module is used in this project
To install this module, hold the ( R + Win ) shortcut keys on your keyboard and type " cmd " and press Enter, and in cmd type 'python pip install colorama'.


This tool works very simply, just run it and tell him how many characters your password has and enter the number of passwords you want to create and then your passwords will be created in the shortest time and in the "password.txt" file.

** I may improve the use of this tool and update it **
